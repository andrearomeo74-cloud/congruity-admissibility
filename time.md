# Time

Time is not a dimension to be traversed freely.
It is an admissibility constraint imposed by irreversibility.

Systems do not move through time.
They accumulate cost.

---

## Definition

Time emerges from asymmetric accumulation of energetic,
informational, and structural cost.

\[
\frac{d(E + I + S)}{dt} \ge 0
\]

This inequality defines temporal direction.
Reversibility is admissible only when cost remains bounded.

## Arrow of Time

The arrow of time is not entropy alone,
but the integrated growth of total system cost.

A system experiences time because:
- Energy dissipates
- Information degrades
- Structure accumulates irreversibly

Time flows where congruity degrades.

## Travel to the Future

Travel to the future is admissible.

Relativistic time dilation reduces the *rate of cost accumulation*
relative to an external reference frame.

This does not violate Congruity:
the traveler pays energetic cost to reduce experienced time.

---

## Why Travel to the Past Is Not Admissible

Travel to the past would require:
- Net negative cost accumulation
- Reversal of informational decay
- Structural deconstruction without residue

This violates admissibility.

Time reversal is not forbidden by equations,
but by proportionality.

## Closed Timelike Curves

CTCs may exist as mathematical solutions,
but they are not admissible regimes.

They require infinite or undefined cost compensation
to preserve coherence.

Congruity flags them as non-physical closures.

---

## Implications

- Physics: clarifies why equations allow reversibility but reality does not
- Cosmology: early universe as low-cost admissible regime
- Biology: aging as cumulative cost asymmetry
- Consciousness: memory creates temporal direction internally

Time is not fundamental.
Irreversibility is.
