# Statement of Admissibility

This repository does not propose a physical theory, a metaphysical doctrine, or a computational model.

It defines **conditions of admissibility**: structural constraints that determine whether a system, process, or description can coherently exist, persist, or be experienced.

The criteria articulated here do not predict outcomes, introduce dynamics, or compete with established theories.
They operate at a prior level:
they specify **what must already hold** for any theory, law, or explanation to be meaningful.

Collapse, consciousness, and time are treated not as mechanisms to be explained,
but as **boundary phenomena** that reveal when proportionality, coherence, or closure breaks.

Congruity, in this context, is not an optimization principle.
It is an **admissibility condition**.

If a system violates admissibility, no increase in power, scale, energy, or information can restore coherence.
