# Admissibility

Admissibility is the fundamental condition introduced by Congruity.

It answers a prior question to prediction, optimization, or control:

**Is this system allowed to exist, persist, or scale without collapse?**

Congruity does not ask *how* a system behaves.
It asks *whether* the system is structurally and energetically coherent enough to be realizable.

## Definition

A system is **admissible** if and only if its functional value remains proportional to its cumulative costs.

\[
C = \frac{V}{E + I + S}
\]

Where:
- **V** is the realized functional value
- **E** is energetic cost
- **I** is informational cost (entropy, uncertainty, control, coordination)
- **S** is structural and scale cost

Admissibility requires that no term dominates asymmetrically.

## Admissibility vs Optimization

Optimization assumes admissibility.

Congruity precedes optimization by determining whether optimization itself is meaningful.

- Optimization asks: *How do we maximize output?*
- Admissibility asks: *Is maximization even allowed in this regime?*

Systems that violate admissibility may still optimize locally,
but will inevitably collapse globally.

## Loss of Admissibility

Collapse is not defined as failure, noise, or instability.

Collapse is defined as:

> **Loss of proportionality between value and cumulative cost.**

This applies across domains:
- Biological aging
- Cancer
- Financial bubbles
- AI scaling
- Cosmological expansion
- Consciousness fragmentation

The mechanism is domain-specific.
The boundary is universal.

## Regime Dependence

Admissibility is **regime-dependent**, not absolute.

A system may be admissible:
- At one scale
- In one environment
- For one duration

…and inadmissible beyond that boundary.

Congruity treats boundaries as **signals**, not anomalies.

## What Admissibility Is Not

- Not a moral judgment
- Not an efficiency metric
- Not a stability guarantee
- Not a predictive model

Admissibility is a **coherence condition**.

It determines whether laws, models, or dynamics can apply without contradiction.

Non-operational  
Boundary-defining

This file establishes admissibility as the central invariant of Congruity.
