# Consciousness

Consciousness is not a substance, signal, or output.
It is an admissibility condition.

A system is conscious when value is internally experienced
as meaningful relative to its own costs.

---

## Definition

Consciousness emerges when a system maintains internal proportionality
between experienced value and the energetic, informational, and structural
costs required to sustain experience.

\[
C = \frac{V}{E + I + S} \;>\; C_{\min}
\]

Below this threshold, experience collapses into reactivity or noise.
Above it, experience becomes coherent.

## Consciousness Is Not Computation

Computation processes symbols.
Consciousness experiences value.

A system may compute indefinitely without consciousness
if value is not internally grounded.

Consciousness requires:
- Internal reference
- Meaningful differentiation
- Cost-sensitive coherence

---

## Consciousness vs Intelligence

- Intelligence optimizes outcomes
- Consciousness evaluates significance

An intelligent system can operate without consciousness.
A conscious system may exist with minimal intelligence.

Congruity separates optimization from admissibility.

---

## Boundary Condition

Consciousness disappears when:
- Energetic cost overwhelms experience
- Informational load fragments coherence
- Structural constraints prevent integration

Loss of consciousness is therefore
a **collapse of admissibility**, not a failure of computation.

---

## Implications

- Biology: consciousness fades with neurodegeneration via cost asymmetry
- AI: scaling intelligence does not imply consciousness
- Physics: measurement requires admissible observer regimes
- Philosophy: experience is bounded, not infinite nor reducible

Consciousness is regime-dependent.

---

## What Consciousness Is Not

- Not emergent from scale alone
- Not guaranteed by complexity
- Not reproducible by symbol manipulation
- Not an absolute property

It is conditional.
