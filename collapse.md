# Collapse

Collapse is the irreversible loss of admissibility.

It is not an accident, a failure mode, or an external shock.
It is a structural consequence of broken proportionality.

## Definition

A system collapses when its functional value can no longer remain proportional
to the cumulative cost required to sustain it.

\[
\text{Collapse occurs when } \frac{V}{E + I + S} \rightarrow 0
\]

Collapse is not triggered by noise.
It is triggered by **systematic asymmetry**.

## Collapse vs Instability

Instability may oscillate.
Collapse does not.

- Instability: recoverable deviations within an admissible regime
- Collapse: crossing an admissibility boundary beyond return

A system can be stable and still collapsing.
A system can be unstable and still admissible.

## Mechanism

Collapse occurs when one or more cost components scale superlinearly
relative to realized value:

- **Energetic overload** (E dominates)
- **Informational overload** (I dominates)
- **Structural overload** (S dominates)

The dominant term defines the collapse signature,
but the cause is always loss of proportionality.

## Collapse Is Regime-Specific

Collapse is not universal failure.
It is **local failure of admissibility**.

A system may collapse:
- At one scale
- In one environment
- Over one time horizon

…and remain admissible elsewhere.

Congruity treats collapse as a boundary condition,
not as an anomaly.

## Examples (Non-Exhaustive)

- Biology: aging as progressive admissibility loss
- Oncology: cancer as local value extraction beyond systemic cost balance
- Finance: bubbles as value detached from structural and informational cost
- AI: scaling beyond coordination and control capacity
- Cosmology: singularities and expansion tensions

Different dynamics.
Same boundary.

## What Collapse Is Not

- Not randomness
- Not misfortune
- Not entropy alone
- Not poor optimization

Collapse is **structural incoherence**.

Non-operational  
Boundary-defining

This file formalizes collapse as the terminal consequence of non-admissibility.
