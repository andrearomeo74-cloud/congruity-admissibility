# Congruity Admissibility

This repository formalizes **admissibility** as the core condition of the Congruity framework.

Congruity does not describe forces, mechanisms, or dynamics.  
It defines **when a system is allowed to exist, persist, or scale without collapse**.

## Canonical Law
\[
C = \frac{V}{E + I + S}
\]

Where:
- **V** = functional value
- **E** = energy cost
- **I** = informational cost
- **S** = structural / scale cost

A system is **admissible** only if proportionality is preserved.

## What this repository addresses
- Collapse as **loss of admissibility**, not failure of mechanics  
- Boundaries (consciousness, free will, measurement, time) as **regime limits**
- Why scaling beyond admissibility produces incoherence, not progress

## What this is NOT
- Not a physical theory
- Not a consciousness model
- Not an operational or predictive system

This is a **meta-law of coherence**, applicable across domains.
